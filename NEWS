Not much to say here this time.  Everything you need to know is in the

version 0.6 (Apr 06th, 2001):

Sorry about the late release.  Our internet connection was having issues last
week so we couldn't release on schedule.  The TucanBBS interface has been
added in this release and is mostly complete.  The next few releases will
be mostly filling in missing methods and getting everything ready for
1.0.

version 0.5 (Mar 23rd, 2001):

Fixed _a lot_ of memory leaks.  I believe that our feature freeze will be over
after this release.  I'll be going back through the stores and implementing the
rest of the methods and making sure that everything is good and happy.  I'll
also begin coding on the Bulletin Board interface.  Hopefully this will go quickly.

version 0.4 (Mar 06th, 2001):

Yet another release out the door!  This release is motsly a bug fix
release.  We fixed a few memory leaks, added some exception handling, fixed
some segfaults, and fixed some parsing errors.  We support a few more
email encodings and have added an AddressBook transport layer.

version 0.3 (Feb 27th, 2001):

Howdy!  TUCAN version 0.3 is now ready for the masses.  It
now has a base set of voice mail, fax, and address book
implementations.  I've also fixed a problem or two with the
pop3 library.  I added IMAP support, too.  Hopefully we'll
start seeing things come together even more for next
week's release.

version 0.1 (Feb 6th, 2001):
	
Hello, and welcome to the initial release of TUCAN.  
We've tried to lay things out in a some what easy
manner for you.  You can find all of the documentation, 
in html format, in the docs subdirectory.  In this release
we have implemented a base set of methods for Email 
and Calendaring.  We will continue to add more features and 
implement more message types as development continues.  
Voice mail and faxes as well as a bulletin board are planned
in the future.
