This is the layout for the backends for the test_tucan script.
The script will look in the its current directory for subdirectories.
These subdirectories are consider to be its available backends for testing.
The script will attempt to execute a script in that directory that is the
same name of the directory.  So for example lets say that you want to add
a script for testing the TucanAddressBook backend.  The first step would
be to create a directory by the name of TucanAddressBook and to then put an
executable script in that directory by the name of TucanAddressBook. So now
you could run:

	./test_tucan -b TucanAddressBook -i 10

this would run your backend script 10 times.  Or you could do this:

	./test_tucan -i 10

this will run every backend currently available in the directory 10 times.
Or you could just do this:

	./test_tucan

this would run all the backend tests available one time.  This is all the
functionality that the script has at the moment but we will be adding lots
of things as we go along.
