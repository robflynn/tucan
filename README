This code was written for and open sourced by Difinium
in 2000 and 2001.  I recently re-discovered the old
repository on SourceForge and decided to bring it
over here for safe keeping. This is probably of
absolutely no use to anyone anymore.

The code was written to be a unified communication
system. It makes use of C++ and Corba to do its
thing.

Don't judge me for the bad code, this was 15 years ago
(and now I feel old.)
