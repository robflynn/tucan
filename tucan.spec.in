%description
Tucan is an API for performing abstract messaging in Linux.
It is built on top of omniORB3.  It is written using C++.
TUCAN currently supports e-mail, voice mail, fax, calendar/scheduler,
an address book, and a BBS system.  It also has interfaces for POP3 as 
well as IMAP. More implementations coming soon!  TUCAN is da bomb! :)
